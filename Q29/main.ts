// Favorite Fruit: Make a array of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of 
// independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your array.
// • Make a array of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.

// • Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your array.
//  If the fruit is in your array, the if block should print a statement, such as
//   You really like bananas!
